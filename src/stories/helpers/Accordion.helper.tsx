          <br />
          <p>
            Please note that while all credit cards support recurring payments, only a few select Indian debit
            cards support recurring payments: ICICI Bank India, Citibank India, Canara Bank India and, Kotak
            Mahindra Bank. If you have a credit card, we suggest you use a credit card instead of a debit
            card. In case you choose the first payment option and use a debit card that doesn’t support a
            recurring payment, your subscription is treated as a one time subscription. We accept all major
            international credit and debit cards. If you’re based overseas and want to have a recurring
            subscription in USD, you can use PayPal too.
